            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <blockquote>"All things begin with an idea." - Earl Nightingale</blockquote>
            <p>
                <b>Oracle Corporation</b> is a large international computer technology company based in the United States, Austin, Texas.<br>
                Oracle was founded in 1977 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison">Larry Ellison</a> along with his partners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Miner">Bob Miner</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Oates">Ed Oates</a> under the name <i>SDL</i>, or its full name "<b>S</b>oftware <b>D</b>evelopment <b>L</b>aboratories."<br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>What about the name?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Software Development Laboratories</b> later changed its name to <b>"Relational Software, Inc"</b> in 1979 and then again to <b>"Oracle Systems Corporation"</b> in 1983 to better align with its flagship product, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle Database</a>.<br>
                A few years later (1989), Oracle moved its headquarters to Redwood Shores near the city of Redwood City, California, and finally changed its name to <b>Oracle Corporation</b> (as we know it today).<br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>We like business</h3>
            <p>
                Part of Oracle's success was due to the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C programming language</a>, which is supported by various operating systems and is easy to manipulate and adapt to other systems,
                Oracle continued its <i>path to success</i> by acquiring several companies, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleSoft">PeopleSoft</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEA_Systems">BEA Systems</a>, and others. In an attempt to compete with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">Amazon Web Services</a> and its products.
            </p>
            <div class="centered-img">

            </div>
            <p>
                Oracle even went as far as announcing a partnership with <b>former rival</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> which included a direct connection between the two companies, allowing customers to store data on <b>both cloud computing systems and run applications on either Oracle or Azure</b>.<br><br>
                Later, Oracle announced its move to Austin, Texas (where it is located today), and a year later made several interesting business moves, including the acquisition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerner">Cerner</a> and the subsequent purchase of <b>Federos</b>, an AI and automation tool for improving communication performance, which cost <b>$28.3 billion in cash</b>.<br><br>
                Oracle offers a wide range of products including <b>database software</b>, <b>cloud services</b>, <b>enterprise software</b>, <b>EPM</b>, and <b>SCM</b>.

                Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is different because it was designed with a primary focus on enterprise production workloads.  Oracle's Infrastructure-as-a-Service brings an enterprise-focused design approach to both basic cloud resources and new capabilities, ensuring you can migrate business critical applications without compromises.</p>
